            formed against the CCP, the notions around COVID-19 has impacted the 
            choices daily Americans make in terms of medical health. Moreover, 
            the recent opinions formed against the newly introduced vaccines 
            have caused a great amount of controversy. Keep in mind however that

            opinions formed about the COVID-19 vaccines. So in this project, 
            we will be observing the relationships between vaccine hesitancy, 
            a existing scale within our dataset, and state education through 
            graduation rates and per-pupil spending. To ultimately find out if
