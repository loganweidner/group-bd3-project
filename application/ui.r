            confusion, has caused doubts between the American public and the 
            U.S. government/companies. From the mask mandate to the ideologies 
            formed against the CCP, the notions around COVID-19 has impacted the 
            choices daily Americans make in terms of medical health. Moreover, 
            the recent opinions formed against the newly introduced vaccines 
            have caused a great amount of controversy. Keep in mind however that 
            some communities don't have access to certain forms of technological 
            communication and education which can drastically influence the 
            opinions formed about the COVID-19 vaccines. So in this project, 
            we will be observing the relationships between vaccine hesitancy, 
            a existing scale within our dataset,and state education through 
            graduation rates and per-pupil spending. To ultimately find out if 
            education is a prominent factor in the hesitancy of vaccines. "),
