## Intro 
The COVID-19 Pandemic, due to the unexpected chaos and confusion, has caused
doubts between the American public and the U.S. government/companies. From the 
mask mandate to the ideologies formed against the CCP, the notions around 
COVID-19 has impacted the choices daily Americans make in terms of medical
health. Moreover, the recent opinions formed against the newly introduced 
vaccines have caused a great amount of controversy. Keep in mind however that 
some communities don't have access to certain forms of technological 
communication and education which can drastically influence the opinions formed 
about the COVID-19 vaccines. So in this project, we will be observing the 
relationships between "vaccine hesitancy", a existing scale within our dataset,
and state education through graduation rates and per-pupil spending. To 
ultimately find out if education is a prominent factor in the hesitancy of 
vaccines.
